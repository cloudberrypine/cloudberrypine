### Lyric Video - Aftonro
I created a lyric video for the song <b>Aftonro</b> by <b>Daggdala</b>. The camera is flying over an endless mountain range. The lyrics talk about finding rest in nature. As the song progresses the evening turns into night and northern lights appear.

### A Musical Journey in Three Acts
I created a music visualization in three acts where each act represents a close family member. The calming piano accompanies a starlit sky where constellations, an abstract dragon and abstract lights fly across the screen.
