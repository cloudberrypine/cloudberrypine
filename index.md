### Lyric Video - Aftonro
We created a lyric video for the song <b>Aftonro</b> by <b>Daggdala</b>. The camera is flying over an endless mountain range. The lyrics about finding peace as the sun sets inspired the visuals. As the song progresses the evening turns into night and northern lights appear.

### A Musical Journey in Three Acts
We created a music visualization in three acts where each act represents a close family member. The calming piano accompanies a starlit sky where constellations, an abstract dragon and abstract lights fly across the screen.
